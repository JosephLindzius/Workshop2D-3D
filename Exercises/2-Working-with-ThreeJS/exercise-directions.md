# Chapter Two
#### Work with Three.JS

The goal of this exercise is to make 3D objects using Three.js through some simple Javascript.    

###### Step One

Add Three.js from the assets/libraries to the HTML document.  You do not need to add a canvas   

###### Step Two

Add scene, camera, renderer.  If needed check documentation how to make these special THREE objects.  

##### Step Three

Add some objects (cube, cone, etc) and include at least two lights.  

##### Step Four

Add animation loop and make your objects rotation, move, scale, etc.  Do whatever your creativity takes you.
